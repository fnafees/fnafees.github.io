# fnafees.github.io
My name is Farzeen Nafees, a high school senior who hopes to use Github as a resource to help me further my pursuit of programming. I hope to combine my passion for coding with some of my other hobbies, such as basketball and video games. Currently, my github houses projects I made with Operation Spark, which are websites built on html, css and java. Python and Java are also among my capabilities and any major project I make with either will be on here.
